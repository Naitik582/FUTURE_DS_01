<h1>Social Media Trend Analysis</h1>

This project helps in identifying what topics are trending on social media by analyzing user comments/posts.



**Objective**

1. To extract most common keywords or topics people are discussing.

2. To clean and process raw text data for better analysis.



**Dataset**

1. A CSV file with social media comments or posts (like social_media_comments.csv).



**Tools & Libraries Used**

1. Python

2. Pandas – for reading and working with the dataset

3. NLTK – for text cleaning and tokenization

4. Collections – to count word frequencies

5. Matplotlib & WordCloud – to create a word cloud of trending words



**Main Steps Done**

1. Load the CSV file with text data


2. Clean the text

• Convert to lowercase

• Remove punctuation and numbers

• Remove stopwords (common words like 'the', 'is', etc.)



3. Tokenize the text (split into words)


4. Count most common words


5. Create a Word Cloud to visualize popular keywords



**Output**

1. A list of top trending words

2. A WordCloud image showing most frequent keywords in larger font



**Skills Gained**

1. Text preprocessing

2. Keyword extraction using Python

3. Data visualization with WordCloud

4. NLTK for natural language processing tasks
